Workflow :
We worked together to convert the task into scrums in Jira, then we put them into relevent epics and decided to split the work.
Michael is working on the Main file and Asif is working on the Bloom Filter and the false positive solution, both working together on the docker file.

TDD :
Asif - I've worked on Bloom Filter class making tests for the constructor, using getters. Then, the AddItem function tested by checking if there's one's inside
the bit array using. getItem tested the most because I can test all the class function using this function.
All the tests build using google tests and the function built like teached in class, red green refactoring.

Refatoring : 
Asif - I've worked using the method we studied in class, red green refactoring.
After every green stage I did the most relevent refactoring, an example is to do less ifs or using get and set functions to use the same function to
find the value of the hash used on the URL. After that, we studiet in class the correct strcture of this project and we refactored the classes to 
work with less dependency with each other.
